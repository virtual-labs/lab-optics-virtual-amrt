  "introduction": "The Optics Virtual Lab offers an immersive, interactive platform designed to enhance the understanding of fundamental and advanced concepts in optics through simulation-based experimentation. Utilizing tools such as spectrometers, prisms, and diffraction gratings, students can perform intricate experiments that traditionally require precise instrumentation and controlled laboratory conditions. By leveraging virtual simulations, this lab bridges the gap between theory and practice, making complex optical phenomena like refraction, dispersion, diffraction, and spectral resolution accessible to learners in any setting.<br>The lab features a comprehensive suite of experiments including the determination of prism angle, analysis of i–i′ and i–d curves, calculation of refractive index and dispersive power, and derivation of Cauchy’s constants. In addition, the inclusion of the diffraction grating experiment provides critical insights into wave behavior and interference patterns. This virtual environment not only strengthens students’ conceptual clarity but also enhances their experimental skills by enabling repeated trials, data recording, and graph plotting in a risk-free, self-paced environment.",
